**Real-Time Sign Language Detection**

_Challenge:_  
Develop a system that utilizes digital image processing and machine learning to recognize and interpret sign language gestures in real-time, aiding individuals with hearing impairments in inclusive communication.  

_Action:_  
- Utilized **TensorFlow Object Detection API** to create a real-time sign language detection model.  
- Collected 15 images for each of 5 sign language gestures: "hello," "yes," "no," "thank you," and "I love you."  
- Implemented a 6-step process:  
  1. Captured real-time images using a webcam and labeled gestures.  
  2. Converted datasets into TFRecord format for training and testing.  
  3. Applied transfer learning with a pre-trained **SSD MobileNet V2 FPNLite** model for fine-tuning.  
  4. Configured a model pipeline and trained it over 10,000 steps to enhance accuracy.  
  5. Restored the model checkpoint for real-time inference.

**Customer Cancellation Analysis for Resort Hotels**  
  Provided actionable insights to reduce cancellation rates and optimize revenue strategies for hotels.

_Challenge:_ Analyze and reduce hotel booking cancellation rates from 13–29% to 10% within a year while addressing revenue decline caused by customer cancellations.

_Action:_ 
- Data Cleaning: Processed raw datasets by handling null values, correcting data types, addressing outliers, and removing logical errors using Python.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed linear regression and data analysis with Python and Google Sheets to understand trends and patterns.
- Visualization: Built insightful dashboards using Looker Studio to highlight trends in booking cancellations, ADR (average daily rate), and system performance.
- Root Cause Identification: Conducted an issue tree analysis to pinpoint factors contributing to cancellations, such as system delays, deposit policies, and lack of service updates.
- Recommendations & Policies: Suggested key improvements, including deposit requirements, improved system response times, and better customer communication.

_Result:_
- Identified high cancellation rates for bookings without deposits (49.29% for Resort Hotels and 49.14% for City Hotels in 2017).
- Proposed implementing deposit policies to lower cancellation rates.
- Provided strategies to optimize revenue by reducing lead times, increasing staff, and upgrading systems to improve service quality.
- Highlighted actionable insights for improving ADR competitiveness and minimizing cancellation impact.

_Additional Insights & Recommendations:_
- City Hotels can attract more customers by lowering prices by at least 9.4% and enhancing service quality.
- Resort Hotels should focus on promoting leisure travel to capitalize on their lower cancellation rates.
- Sending booking reminders and offering rescheduling options can reduce cancellations and enhance customer retention.
